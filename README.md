Copy the starter repository to your Github account. Then log into an ieng6
machine and clone it.

Next, when logged into ieng6 or the pi-cluster (either should work), run these
two commands:

$ echo "alias pa1-runner='/home/linux/ieng6/cs30f/public/pa1-runner'" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile

This will set things up so you can directly run the {\tt pa1-runner} command.
It won't work unless you perform these steps.

See [this description](./description.pdf) for instructions.
